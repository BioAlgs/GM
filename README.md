# Gaussian Mirror for High-dimensional Controled Variable Selection


##Installation






##Example 1
This example illustrates the basic usage of the GM package. The GM method is designed for any design matrix. For simplicity, we will use synthetic data constructed from a linear model such that the response only depends on a small fraction of the variables.


```R
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
